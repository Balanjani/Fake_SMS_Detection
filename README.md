# Fake_SMS_Detection
The project by TrustText Team aims to develop a chatbot capable of detecting fake SMS messages using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which contains labeled SMS messages. These messages are categorized into two classes: ham (legitimate messages) and spam (fraudulent messages)
